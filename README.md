**Summary**

I have developed strong foundational skills across Linux administration, containerization, automation, networking, DevOps tools, and backend development. Below is a concise overview of the knowledge and hands-on experience I have gained:

**Operating System & Linux Administration**
Gained a solid understanding of operating system concepts and effective use of the Linux environment. Learned and practiced key Linux commands such as `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `chmod`, `chown`, `ps`, `ps aux`, `su`, `pwd`, and `ping`. Created and deleted users and groups, assigned file and directory permissions, and monitored and terminated system processes when required.

**Git & GitHub (Version Control and Collaboration)**
Learned Git as a distributed version control system. Initialized and tracked projects using `git init`, `git add`, and `git commit`. Created and managed branches with `git branch` commands and connected local repositories to GitHub using `git remote add` and `git push`. Understood version history, collaborative workflows, and remote repository management.

**Python Programming (Basics)**
Built foundational knowledge of Python, covering data types, variables, operators, and control flow using conditionals and loops. Wrote small automation scripts and backend logic to support application development.

**PostgreSQL Database**
Installed and configured PostgreSQL with user authentication. Created databases and tables, and practiced inserting, retrieving, and managing data through SQL queries.

**Docker & Containerization**
Learned containerization concepts and wrote Dockerfiles to build and deploy Python applications. Successfully built Docker images and ran containers, ensuring environment consistency and portability.

**Docker Compose**
Created multi-container setups using Docker Compose to manage and orchestrate multiple microservices. Automated container networking and service dependencies for seamless integration.

**Shell Scripting (Bash)**
Developed Bash scripts to automate system monitoring tasks, including date/time checks, uptime, CPU load, memory, and disk usage. Created automation scripts for generating multiple files and directories efficiently.

**Networking Protocols & Mail Delivery Tools**
Gained an understanding of how systems communicate over networks. Worked with tools like Dovecot, Postfix, and Mailutils for email sending and receiving. Used Telnet and OpenSSL for protocol testing and secure communication, and Tcpdump for network traffic analysis.

**RabbitMQ, Celery, and Ngrok Integration**
Built an automated email notification workflow integrating Python (backend), RabbitMQ (message broker), and Celery (task manager), exposed through Ngrok and Nginx. Configured `.env` credentials for secure automation and verified that messages were sent automatically upon triggering the application.

**Jenkins – Continuous Integration (CI)**
Installed and configured Jenkins with essential plugins such as Git, Java, Python, and SSL/TLS tools. Created automated CI pipelines triggered by GitHub webhooks to build and test applications upon every code push. Managed Jenkins users and assigned appropriate roles and permissions.

**DevOps Utility – Fetch**
Used Fetch as a utility tool to create quick access shortcuts for servers, containers, and file listings on Ubuntu, improving operational efficiency.
